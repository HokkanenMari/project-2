Created a project where user can search for the weather of chosen city. It shows current weather and 5 next days weather. The weather results include temperature (in Celsius), description (rainy, etc.), icon of the weather and humidity. The result card also includes which day and time it is showing. 

Udes API: https://openweathermap.org/

I had too little time for this project, so unfortunately I had to do it in a hurry and didn’t have time to dive deeply into everything. However, it was wonderful to learn more about coding again and to notice that I was able to edit code a little better than before. A large part of the JavaScript code still feels really difficult to understand. The most fun part was that I wanted to add the ability to use the Enter key in the search field, and I managed to make it work!
